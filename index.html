                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hi, My name is Sumathi(didn't know how else to start this!) , I worked as a software developer 
                    after my grad school which was time period before google went public and everyone used Netscape!
                    I stopped working due to some family reasons and after few years of stay at home mom, I lost 
                    the confidence that I would be able to keep up with the changing tech! So, started tutoring math
                    for middle school, high school, college students. I did an online MS(CS) course, but completed 
                    credits over very long period of time with lot of Google-fu and no hands on experience! 
                    Now, facing with two options -either go to school and complete a degree in education and become 
                    a high school math teacher/ brave into the world of IT ..... I put all my savings into this 
                    course, and here I am  - Smart? <strong> :/ </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal is complete the course with an outstanding profile
                    ( which I  trust RCB  team would <strong ><u> help</u> </strong> me build ), 
                    land an amzing job, buy a house on the beach.
                </p>
